# Team 7 - Password Manager App

This repository contains the code for the Password Manager app developed by Team 7.


Use Story

This application serves as a Password Manager. It will allow users to securely store their passwords and associated details such as usernames and email addresses for future use. 

When the app is opened for the first time, the user is prompted to create a master password. This master password is required to access the app in subsequent uses. If the master password is ever lost, the user will lose access to the stored passwords. This measure ensures the integrity and security of the saved passwords, preventing unauthorized access to the app.

Once the user successfully accessed the app, all previously saved passwords are displayed. The user also has the option to delete all passwords in the settings section by confirming the deletion in a dialog box. Additionally, the user can change the master password using the provided option in the spinner section.

Features
The Password Manager app demonstrates the use of various concepts taught in class, including:

1. Intents
2. Spinner
3. Values Directory (e.g., string resource file, colors, styles, etc.)
4. TextView
5. EditText
6. Button
7. ImageView
8. ImageButton
9. Back button
10. Event listeners
11. Toast messages
12. Permissions
13. SharedPreferences
14. Background color
15. Toggle Button
16. Dialog, etc.

 Extras
The app also includes a splash screen feature.


Known Issues or Limitations
While we have made efforts to create a robust app, there are a few known issues or limitations:
-You can’t delete individual passwords
-You can’t get your master password back if you lose it
-You can’t change the apps’ font size or font style

I will actively work to address these issues and will update the app in future releases and will appreciate your patience.
